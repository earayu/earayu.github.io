Hi, I'm Bryce Yu.<br />
I am a database kernel engineer and an open-source enthusiast.<br />
Currently, I am contributing to [WeScale](https://github.com/wesql/wescale), a database proxy designed to enhance the scalability, performance, security, and resilience of applications.
My contributions include implementing features such as Read-Write Splitting, Read-After-Write Consistency, Load Balancing, and Online DDL.


Previously, I worked in the [PolarDB-X](https://github.com/polardb/polardbx-sql) distributed database team at Alibaba, where I was responsible for developing features related to DDL (Data Definition Language). <br />
I Lead the design and implementation of the [DDL execution engine](https://github.com/polardb/polardbx-sql/blob/main/polardbx-executor/src/main/java/com/alibaba/polardbx/executor/ddl/newengine/DdlEngineDagExecutor.java) in PolarDB-X, which allows the database system to maintain ACID properties during schema changes across the cluster.<br />
For more information about PolarDB-X, please refer to [PolarDB-X Paper](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/papers/icde22-polardbx.pdf).

Before that, I was a web backend developer specializing in data-intensive applications. <br />
The experience I gained in both database kernel development and application development has greatly enhanced my architectural design skills.

While I have some familiarity with web front-end technologies, I wouldn't call myself an expert. But I'm currently deepening my knowledge of Next.js, a framework I used to build this blog.
