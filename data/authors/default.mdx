Hi, I'm Bryce Yu.<br />
I am a database kernel engineer and an open-source enthusiast.<br />

Currently, my primary focus is spearheading the development of cutting-edge RAG applications. This involves designing and implementing solutions that deeply integrate Graph RAG and flow engines to significantly enhance knowledge discovery, complex reasoning, and high-quality content generation. This work is underpinned by a Kubernetes DevOps ecosystem that I lead in building and maintaining to support efficient iteration and deployment.

I also remain a core contributor to [WeScale](https://github.com/wesql/wescale), a database proxy designed to enhance the scalability, performance, and resilience of MySQL. My contributions there include features like [Read-Write Splitting](https://github.com/wesql/wescale/blob/main/doc%2Fblogs%2FDive%20into%20Read-Write-Splitting%20of%20WeScale.md), [Read-After-Write Consistency](https://github.com/wesql/wescale/blob/main/doc/design/20230414_ReadAfterWrite.md), Load Balancing, Online DDL, Wasm Plugin, and Database Branching.

Previously, I worked in the [PolarDB-X](https://github.com/polardb/polardbx-sql) distributed database team at Alibaba, where I was responsible for developing features related to DDL (Data Definition Language). <br />
I Lead the design and implementation of the [DDL execution engine (Code Here)](https://github.com/polardb/polardbx-sql/blob/main/polardbx-executor/src/main/java/com/alibaba/polardbx/executor/ddl/newengine/DdlEngineDagExecutor.java) in PolarDB-X, which allows the database system to maintain ACID properties during schema changes.<br />

I am also actively maintaining the [WeSQL](https://wesql.io/) and [KubeBlocks](https://kubeblocks.io/) open source communities. If you find these projects interesting, please consider giving them a star on GitHub. Your support helps grow our communities!

I'm open to opportunities in various fields including but not limited to AI, Database Development, Cloud Infrastructure, and emerging technologies where I can apply my expertise in building scalable systems.
