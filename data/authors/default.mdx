Hi, I'm Bryce Yu.<br />
I am a database kernel engineer, and open source lover.<br />
Currently, I am working on [WeScale](https://github.com/wesql/wescale), a database proxy designed to enhance the scalability, performance, security, and resilience of applications.
I have implemented features such as Read-Write Splitting, Read-After-Write Consistency, Load Balancing, and Online DDL for it.


I used to worked in the [PolarDB-X](https://github.com/polardb/polardbx-sql) distributed database team at Alibaba and am responsible for developing DDL-related features. <br />
I Lead the design and implementation of the [DDL execution engine](https://github.com/polardb/polardbx-sql/blob/main/polardbx-executor/src/main/java/com/alibaba/polardbx/executor/ddl/newengine/DdlEngineDagExecutor.java) in PolarDB-X, it allows the database system to preserve ACID properties while performing schema changes on the cluster.<br />
For more information about PolarDB-X, please refer to [PolarDB-X Paper](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/papers/icde22-polardbx.pdf).

Previously, I worked as a web backend developer with a focus on data-intensive applications. <br />
The skills I've acquired from both database kernel development and application development have contributed to my understanding of architectural design.

I have some knowledge of web front-end technologies, though I wouldn't consider myself an expert. However, I'm currently learning Next.js, and this blog was built using Next.js.
