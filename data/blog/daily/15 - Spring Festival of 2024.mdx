Chinese Spring Festival is the largest human migration event every year. Billions of trips take place during the
spring festival travel crush. Transport tickets sell out quickly and the prices rise. Yet nothing would prevent
people from returning to their hometown after working hard outside for an entire year. For those
who work in their hometowns, it's a precious chance to take a trip to a faraway destination.

I took a self-driving trip to Jiangxi province with my girlfriend this year. To avoid the traffic jam, we set out at
the second day of the festival, and planned to return one day before the end of the festival. It turned out we successfully
escaped the giant traffic jam, but the trip still cost us 50% more of the time on highways than usual.

We arrived at Nanchang, the capital city of Jiangxi province, after 10 hours of driving at the first day. I was exhausted
and hungry, but the Nanchang mixed rice noodle and a bunch of delicious snacks brought me alive. The food in Nanchang is
famous for its savory, salty, and spicy flavors.
Nanchang is actually the city where I went to college. Although I studied there for almost 4 years, I didn't visited many
places in the city, including the most famous Tengwang pavilion. PuPu, my girlfriend, and I visited Tengwang pavilion
the following day, where we enjoyed a captivating dance and light show.

Then we went to Jingdezhen, a city famous for its porcelain industry since ancient times.

Afterwards, we traveled to Wuyuan with the hope of viewing the canola flower fields. Unfortunately, the Spring Festival
falls too early for the canola flowers to bloom. But we did enjoy the ancient architecture there.

The last place we visited is Sanqing mountain, which is famous for its breathtaking view and significant connection to taoism.
The name "Sanqing" actually originates from Laozi, the forefather of Taoism. Unfortunately, the weather was foggy and rainy,
so we didn't get the chance to view the scenery.

The trip was a little bit of hurry and the weather was not perfect, but we still enjoyed the trip. I believe that the
quality of a trip is not determined by the scenery or the food. Instead, it is more important to have an open mind
and curiosity towards the world.
