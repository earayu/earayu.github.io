# Introduction
When I worked in Alibaba Cloud PolarDB-X team, I tried to design a distributed read-write lock for its DDL execution engine.
The lock is used to ensure that only one DDL can be executed at the same time.
I wasn't realized that there are so many things to consider when designing read-write lock, and I learned a lot from this experience.

# Background

PolarDB-X is a distributed database inspired by MySQL. It features a distributed DDL execution engine to handle DDL operations across its nodes.
These operations are managed by a leader node, which either executes them directly or delegates them to other nodes.
DDL operations can be paused, resumed, and run in parallel, necessitating a robust distributed lock system to prevent simultaneous modifications on the same table.



# Functionality Considerations

All DDLs in Polardb-X are executed asynchronously, and can be paused and resumed. Users can track the status of a DDL using a JobId.
It means, Unlike MySQL, DDLs' lifecycle is not bounded with a single connection, it's bounded with a JobId.
So the lock should be persistent, and it should be released when the DDL is finished. Since Polardb-X is a distributed database, the lock should be distributed.
I realized that I need a Linearizable storage to implement the lock. But I didn't want to introduce a new dependency, so I used Polardb-X itself as the storage.


The lock should serve read and write operations, and read operations are more frequent than write operations. So obviously, I need a read-write lock.
I love reentrant locks, because they are easy to use. Impicit lock upgrade is also a good feature, so I decided to support them too.

Since the lock is used only for DDLs, it's not necessary to implement lock fairness.

# API Interface Considerations

Polardb-X will generate a plan for each DDL before executing it. The plan contains all the locks that the DDL needs to acquire.
So I decided not to implement deadlock detection, instead, I implemented a batch tryLock interface, which can try to acquire all the locks after the plan is generated.
It's more efficient than try to acquire each lock one by one, and it also can avoid deadlock.

The lock should be released when the DDL is finished, so I didn't implement lock timeout.

# Performance Considerations

When multiple locks are needed for a DDL, the system attempts to acquire them all at once.
A failure to do so leads to a retry, reminiscent of a spin lock, which is not the most resource-efficient.
I considered a futex-like solution that would allow a thread to sleep upon failure and wake once the lock becomes available.

However, my aim was to keep the system simple, so I chose not to implement this mechanism despite its potential to enhance performance.
